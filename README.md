# ðŸš† PyTrain-Management

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Welcome to **PyTrain-Management** â€” your one-stop solution for managing train bookings! This Python-based project, built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), simplifies the entire train journey process, from scheduling trains to generating detailed passenger receipts. Whether you're booking a short trip or a long journey, this system has all the features you need.

## âœ¨ Features

- **ðŸ’¡ Intuitive OOP Structure**: The core of the system is designed using Python's OOP principles, ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **ðŸŽ« Seamless Ticket Booking**: Effortlessly book train tickets with minimal inputs and receive a comprehensive receipt at the end.
- **ðŸ•’ Train Info**: Access train schedules and routes quickly and easily.
- **ðŸ“„ Automated Receipt Generation**: Instantly receive a detailed receipt with all key information, including passenger details, train name, timings, and fare breakdown after each booking.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the project.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Provides a flexible and well-structured design, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- **sqlite3**: This lightweight SQL database is used to store all crucial information, such as available train routes, passenger details, ticket bookings, and more. It provides efficient data handling with quick lookups, updates, and inserts, ensuring that all passenger and train information is consistently stored and easily retrievable. The integration of sqlite3 also makes the system easily adaptable for future expansions, such as transitioning to a more advanced database if needed.

## ðŸ’» How It Works

- **The Train Management System operates through a simple command-line interface. Users can book tickets, view available trains, and receive detailed receipts. Behind the scenes, OOP principles are utilized for efficient data management and organization, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience.**
